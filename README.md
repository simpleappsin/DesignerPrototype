<h1>Designer Software</h1>
<p>Designer is a web design software. Currently, the project is very new and I am still working on the UI elements of the software and testing some codes.
The software is planned to be donation-based free software.</p>
<h2>Motivation Behind</h2>
<p>I want to be able to develop my skills and learn new things while trying new ideas. I also love challenges and I believe I will be running into many problems while I am developing this software.
But it is not a problem after all I chose this myself.</p>
<h2>Which Programming Language(s) Is/Are Being Used?</h2>
<p>I am only working with WinForms but this might change in the future depending on how hard it gets, how it affects the project, or if it is impossible to complete the project with it.
I have a second plan in my mind, I might change it to WPF if I see that it is impossible or there is no solution for the problem I am facing at the moment.</p>
